# GTToolsSharp
A port of gttool from flatz for Gran Turismo 5/6 to C#. Unfinished yet, also supports PDIPFS. Repack is planned.

The motivation for this tool is to port over the near unreadability of the other tool, along with future features to be planned.

Source code for the PDIPFS path resolver is implemented. Table of contents can be read for GT.VOL and PDIPFS. **Repacking is a planned feature.**


What does not work yet is unpacking files as the BTree implementation is still ongoing.

Also only the Key set for GT5 build is provided. In the future most of these will be added for most builds of Pre-GT5->GT6.

## Compiling
If you somehow want to compile this partially functioning tool, Visual Studio 2019 Preview & .NET Core 5.0 is required.
