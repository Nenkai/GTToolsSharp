# GTToolsSharp
A port of gttool from flatz for Gran Turismo 5/6 to C#. Unfinished yet, also supports PDIPFS. Repack is planned.

The motivation for this tool is to port over the near unreadability of the other tool, along with future features to be planned.

Source code for the PDIPFS path resolver is implemented. Files can be extracted for GT.VOL (main build volume) and PDIPFS (update patches). **Repacking is a planned feature.**
To unpack certain builds you will need the keys for each one of them. Only the keys for GT5 (EU) are provided.

## Compiling
If you somehow want to compile this, Visual Studio 2019 Preview & .NET Core 5.0 is required.
